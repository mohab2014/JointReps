# JointReps
JointReps is a joint model for learning distributed word vector representations (word embeddings) from both large text corpora and knowledge bases (KBs). 

This tool is the source code for the proposed method reported in the papers titled "Joint Word Representation Learning Using a Corpus and a Semantic Lexicon" and its extened version "Jointly Learning Word Embeddings using a Corpus and a Knowledge Base" submitted to AAAI-2016 and TDKE respectively.
